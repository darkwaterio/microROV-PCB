# microROV Mk2 PCB files

In this directory you'll find the Eagle PCB schematic and board files for the controller and a zip file of the Gerber files you'll need to send to a manufacturer if you don't want to modify the deisgns. We've tried them with [Ragworm](http://ragworm.eu/) and [Oshpark](https://oshpark.com/).

If you want a ready made board, a board with all the parts you need or even a pre-soldered board then you can get them from our [shop](http://darkwater.io/shop/) and help fund future projects.
